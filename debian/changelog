python-simplegeo-places (0.9.0) lucid; urgency=low

  [ Zooko Ofsimplegeo ]
  * more skeleton -- empty classes that the tests (which were just
    copied in from python-simplegeo) are trying to import
  * copy in the constructors of Record from python-simplegeo, causing
    test_record_from_dict() to go green also add
    simplegeo/places/test/test_record.py~, just because there is
    something screwed up in git and this might fix it: You have
    uncommitted changes in your source tree:
  * remove simplegeo/places/test/test_record.py~
  * add dummy file in attempt to clean up mess: x You have uncommitted
    changes in your source tree: x # On branch master x # Changed but
    not updated: x #   (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will
    be committed) x #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard
    changes in working directory) x # x # deleted:
    simplegeo/places/test/test_record.py~
  * remove backup file
  * add dummy backup file in attempt to clean up this mess: You have
    uncommitted changes in your source tree:
  * constructor for Record, tests thereof
  * rename package to "python-simplegeo-places" in setup.py
  * remove backup file
