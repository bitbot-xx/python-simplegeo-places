  * change to new API where every endpoint is named "features" instead
    of "places" not 100% sure that this is really the true final API
    that we want, but whatever. It is easy enough to change and there is
    100% test coverage to make sure we don't overlook some use of it in
    this library.

  * lots more tests, which moved around some things in init noteably:
    request no longer tries to turn things into records because most
    endpts do not give back records

  * add test that it preserves the precise lat/lon that you entered
    (which is why we care about using Decimal instead of float when it
    makes sense to do so)
  * try to hook up test/coverage so that it will get invoked inside
    debian pbuild world and the results thereof will get spurted back
    out into hudson world
  * add python-coverage as a build-dep in debian/control
  * debian renamed "coverage" to "python-coverage"
  * add dep on python-simplejson >= 2.1.0
  * fix up unit tests to test a plausible API (probably not the real API
    though)
  * fix python setup.py --version
  * version bump
